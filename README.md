# Amal project

    Amal target is to connect the refugees to willing supporters who can offer a helping hand to address their problems so they meet their basic requirements.

  <p align="center">
    What inspired us was being a refugee due to the civil war that took place in April 2016 made me experience the hardship that refugees goes through for example waiting  every month for d food and few basic requirements which doesnt Surstaine refugees for the whole month, poor health centers,  low education systems. Hence i wouldn’t like any human being to go pass through the same the experience.
